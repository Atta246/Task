## Simple Interest Calculator

This is a calculator that computes simple interest based on the given principal amount, annual rate of interest, and time period in years.

### Formula
The formula to calculate simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \frac{P \times R \times T}{100} \]

Where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount.
- \( R \) is the annual rate of interest (in percentage).
- \( T \) is the time period (in years).

### Example
If \( P \) is 1000, \( R \) is 5%, and \( T \) is 2 years, the simple interest would be calculated as:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = \frac{1000 \times 5 \times 2}{100} = 100 \]

### Input:
- \( P \): Principal amount
- \( T \): Time period in years
- \( R \): Annual rate of interest (in percentage)

### Output:
- Simple interest calculated using the formula
